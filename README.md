Code from the node begginner book (http://www.nodebeginner.org/)

### Chapter 1
In node you have one main file which you run but that file can run code from modules this way you have a clean main file
It's more or less a standard to name your main file index.js
Itâ€™s common practice to choose the name of the module for the name of the local variable
In functional programming you pass actions not verbs; functions not objects
